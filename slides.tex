\frame{\frametitle{Introduction}

When you ssh to a server you are creating a secure channel on an insecure
network. This channel can be used for more than a remote shell. A tunnel
proxies any kind of traffic through this secure channel.

}

\frame{\frametitle{-L tunnels}

\begin{itemize}

\item listens on local side, forwards traffic through tunnel, it continues to
its destination from remote side

\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example}
\texttt{ssh -L localhost:9978:host-a:80 host-b}
\end{exampleblock}

Traffic to localhost port 9978 will go through the tunnel to host-b then
continue on to host-a port 80.

}

\frame{\frametitle{-R tunnels}

\begin{itemize}

\item listens on remote side, forwards traffic back through tunnel, it
continues to its destination from local side

\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example}
\texttt{ssh -R :9978:host-a:80 host-b}
\end{exampleblock}

Traffic to host-b port 9978 will come back through the tunnel to the local
host and then continue to host-a port 80.

}

\frame{\frametitle{-D tunnels}

\begin{itemize}

\item creates a local SOCKS5 proxy that sends traffic through the tunnel
where it continues to its destination from the remote side.

\item many applications and OSs support SOCKS5

\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example}
\texttt{ssh -D localhost:9978 host-a}
\end{exampleblock}

Applications using the SOCKS5 proxy on localhost port 9978 will have their
traffic send through the tunnel to host-a where it will continue on to
its destination.

}

\frame{\frametitle{Potential Uses}

\begin{itemize}

\item hide your traffic from the local network (workplace, government, school,
hackers at Starbucks)

\item bypass firewalls, NAT and content filters

\item connect to internal web servers and other resources from outside the
network

\item connect networks that don't route to each other

\item secure unencrypted traffic in untrusted environments (instant message,
non-SSL sites, mail)

\item hide your location from web sites (browsing competitor's site from
work)

\item test if something is accessible from a network other than the one
you are on

\end{itemize}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Tools}

\begin{itemize}

\item internet-connected server (at home or VPS)

\item OpenSSH, putty (windows)

\item FoxyProxy (FireFox add-on)

\end{itemize}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Caution}

\begin{itemize}

\item usually only listen on local interfaces, tunnels listening on a public
interface could allow access to sensitive private networks

\item don't forget to use remote DNS or your DNS queries will stay on the
local network and leak information about your traffic

\end{itemize}
